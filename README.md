ONLINE BANKING PROJECT REPORT

INTRODUCTION
During the past several decades personnel function has been transformed from a relatively obscure record keeping staff to central and top level management function. There are many factors that have influenced this transformation like technological advances, professionalism, and general recognition of human beings as most important resources.
A computer based management system is designed to handle all the primary information required to calculate monthly statements of customer account which include monthly statement of any month. Separate database is maintained to handle all the details required for the correct statement calculation and generation.
This project intends to introduce more user friendliness in the various activities such as record updation, maintenance, and searching. The searching of record has been made quite simple as all the details of the customer can be obtained by simply keying in the identification or account number of that customer. Similarly, record maintenance and updation can also be accomplished by using the account number with all the details being automatically generated. These details are also being promptly automatically updated in the master file thus keeping the record absolutely up-to-date.
The entire information has maintained in the database or Files and whoever wants to retrieve can’t retrieve, only authorization user can retrieve the necessary information which can be easily be accessible from the file.

OBJECTIVE OF THE PROJECT
A computer based management system is designed to handle all the primary information required to calculate monthly statements of customer account which include monthly statement of any month. Separate database is maintained to handle all the details required for the correct statement calculation and generation.
This project intends to introduce more user friendliness in the various activities such as record updation, maintenance, and searching. The searching of record has been made quite simple as all the details of the customer can be obtained by simply keying in the identification or account number of that customer. Similarly, record maintenance and updation can also be accomplished by using the account number with all the details being automatically generated. These details are also being promptly automatically updated in the master file thus keeping the record absolutely up-to-date.

INTRODUCTION TO FRONT END TOOL
Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.
HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as <img /> and <input /> directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as <p> surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.
HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997. 

HTML markup consists of several key components, including those called tags (and their attributes), character-based data types, character references and entity references. HTML tags most commonly come in pairs like <h1> and </h1>, although some represent empty elements and so are unpaired, for example <img>. The first tag in such a pair is the start tag, and the second is the end tag (they are also called opening tags and closing tags).
Another important component is the HTML document type declaration, which triggers standards mode rendering.
The following is an example of the classic "Hello, World!" program:
<!DOCTYPE html>
 <html>
 <head>
 <title>This is a title</title>
 </head>
 <body>
<p>Hello world!</p>
</body>
</html>
The text between <html> and </html> describes the web page, and the text between <body> and </body> is the visible page content. The markup text <title>This is a title</title> defines the browser page title.
The Document Type Declaration <!DOCTYPE html> is for HTML5. If a declaration is not included, various browsers will revert to "quirks mode" for rendering. 
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript. 
CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.
Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device. 
The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.
The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents. 
In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS including XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and XUL.

INTRODUCTION TO BACK END TOOL
Introduction to SQL: -
SQL is a standard computer language for accessing and manipulating databases.
•         SQL stands for Structured Query Language.
•         SQL allows you to access a database.
•         SQL is an ANSI standard computer language.
•         SQL can execute queries against a database.
•         SQL can retrieve data from a database.
•         SQL can insert new records in a database.
•         SQL can delete records from a database.
•         SQL can update records in a database.
•         SQL is easy to learn.
 SQL is an ANSI (American National Standards Institute) standard computer language for accessing and manipulating database systems. SQL statements are used to retrieve and update data in a database. SQL works with database programs like MS Access, DB2, Informix, MS SQL Server, Oracle, Sybase, etc.

Unfortunately, there are many different versions of the SQL language, but to be in compliance with the ANSI standard; they must support the same major keywords in a similar manner (such as SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, INSERT, WHERE, and others).
 SQL DATABASE TABLES: -
A database most often contains one or more tables. Each table is identified by a name (e.g. "Customers" or "Orders"). Tables contain records (rows) with data.
Below is an example of a table called "Persons": -
Last Name	First Name	Address	City
Hansen	Ola	Timoteivn 10	Sandnes
Svendson	Tove	Borgvn 23	Sandnes
Pettersen	Kari	Storgt 20	Stavanger

The table above contains three records (one for each person) and four columns (Last Name, First Name, Address, and City).
 
SQL QUERIES: -
With SQL, we can query a database and have a result set returned.
A query like this: -
SELECT Last Name FROM Persons
Gives a result set like this: -
Last Name
Hansen
Svendson
Petersen
SQL Data Manipulation Language (DML)

SQL (Structured Query Language) is syntax for executing queries. But the SQL language also includes syntax to update, insert, and delete records.
These query and update commands together form the Data Manipulation Language (DML) part of SQL: -
SELECT - extracts data from a database table
UPDATE - updates data in a database table
DELETE - deletes data from a database table
INSERT INTO - inserts new data into a database table
 
SQL DATA DEFINITION LANGUAGE (DDL)
The Data Definition Language (DDL) part of SQL permits database tables to be created or deleted. We can also define indexes (keys), specify links between tables, and impose constraints between database tables.
The most important DDL statements in SQL are: - 
	CREATE TABLE - creates a new database table
	ALTER TABLE - alters (changes) a database table
	DROP TABLE - deletes a database table
	CREATE INDEX - creates an index (search key)
	DROP INDEX - deletes an index MS SQL SERVER 2000

OBJECT DIAGRAM
Object is an instance of a particular moment in runtime, including objects and data values. A static UML object diagram is an instance of a class diagram; it shows a snapshot of the detailed state of a system at a point in time, thus an object diagram encompasses objects and their relationships at a point in time. It may be considered a special case of a class diagram or a communication diagram.
The use of object diagrams is fairly limited, mainly to show examples of data structures.
•	During the analysis phase of a project, you might create a class diagram to describe the structure of a system and then create a set of object diagrams as test cases to verify the accuracy and completeness of the class diagram.
•	Before you create a class diagram, you might create an object diagram to discover facts about specific model elements and their links, or to illustrate specific examples of the classifiers that are required.

Below is the object diagram of online banking system:
 

CLASS DIAGRAM
In software engineering, a class diagram in the Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a type of static structure diagram that describes the structure of a system by showing the system's classes, their attributes, operations (or methods), and the relationships among objects.
Shows static structure of classifiers in a system
Diagram provides a basic notation for other structure diagrams prescribed by UML
Helpful for developers and other team members too
Business Analysts can use class diagrams to model systems from a business perspective

Below is the class diagram :

 
COLLABORATION DIAGRAM
Collaboration diagrams are used to show how objects interact to perform the behavior of a particular use case, or a part of a use case. Along with sequence diagrams, collaboration are used by designers to define and clarify the roles of the objects that perform a particular flow of events of a use case.  They are the primary source of information used to determining class responsibilities and interfaces.
A Collaboration is a collection of named objects and actors with links connecting them. They collaborate in performing some task.
A Collaboration defines a set of participants and relationships that are meaningful for a given set of purposes
A Collaboration between objects working together provides emergent desirable functionalities in Object-Oriented systems
Each object (responsibility) partially supports emergent functionalities
Objects are able to produce (usable) high-level functionalities by working together
Objects collaborate by communicating (passing messages) with one another in order to work together
Below is the diagram:
 

SEQUENCE DIAGRAM
Sequence Diagrams are interaction diagrams that detail how operations are carried out. They capture the interaction between objects in the context of a collaboration. Sequence Diagrams are time focus and they show the order of the interaction visually by using the vertical axis of the diagram to represent time what messages are sent and when.
Sequence Diagrams captures:
the interaction that takes place in a collaboration that either realizes a use case or an operation (instance diagrams or generic diagrams)
high-level interactions between user of the system and the system, between the system and other systems, or between subsystems 

Below is the sequence diagram:
 

DATAFLOW DIAGRAM
Also known as DFD, Data flow diagrams are used to graphically represent the flow of data in a business information system. DFD describes the processes that are involved in a system to transfer data from the input to the file storage and reports generation.Data flow diagrams can be divided into logical and physical. The logical data flow diagram describes flow of data through a system to perform certain functionality of a business. The physical data flow diagram describes the implementation of the logical data flow.

Below is the dataflow diagram:
 

UML DIAGRAM
A UML diagram is a diagram based on the UML (Unified Modeling Language) with the purpose of visually representing a system along with its main actors, roles, actions, artifacts or classes, in order to better understand, alter, maintain, or document information about the system.
